# Privacy

## Principle
Camera frames and biometric-like data must not be uploaded by default.

## Allowed telemetry (examples)
- fps, latency
- device tier (bucketed)
- error codes
- feature usage counters

## Not allowed (without explicit consent)
- raw video frames
- face data
- precise location data
